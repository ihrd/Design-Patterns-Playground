# Swift design playgrounds

These are small examples I made in Swift playgrounds while studying common patterns in software development.

# Structure

Playgrounds with just pattern name are cononical implementations form the course. Some have additional versions like State Machine - Native (see below).

[State Machine](https://github.com/ihrd/Design-Patterns-Playground/blob/master/State%20Machine.playground/section-1.swift) and [State Machine - Native](https://github.com/ihrd/Design-Patterns-Playground/blob/master/State%20Machine%20-%20Native.playground/section-1.swift) are best examples so far.

"The problem is, about 1/3 to 1/2 of them were basically cover-ups for deficiencies in C++ that don't exist in other languages. Although I'm not a huge Perl fan anymore, I have to admit the Perl community caught on to this first (or at least funniest). They pointed out that many of these so-called patterns were actually an implementation of Functional Programming in C++. 

The Visitor, for instance, is just a class wrapper for a function with some accumulator variables, something that's achieved far more cleanly with, say, the map() function in higher-level languages. Iterator is a poor man's Visitor. The Strategy pattern is beautiful on the surface, but Strategy objects are typically stateless, which means they're really just first-order functions in disguise. (If they have state, then they're Closures in disguise.) Etc. You either get this, because you've done functional programming before, or you don't, in which case I sound like I'm a babbling idiot, so I guess I'll wrap it up."
